# Epic Web Notes Application

A note-taking application developed following the Epic Web Dev workshops, created by Kent C. Dodds. This project will include everything I learned from the 5 workshops, namely:
- The Full Stack Foundations workshop covers modern web development best practices including Styling, Routing, Data Loading, Forms, SEO, Error Handling, and more!
- The Professional Web Forms Workshop will equip you for building complex, fully accessible forms that handle validation and file uploads while preventing spam.
- The Data Modeling Deep Dive Workshop will teach you best practices for designing database schemas, managing relationships, data mutations, and optimizations.
- Learn best practices for managing user sessions, passwords, 2FA, email verification, OAuth, and more in the Authentication Strategies Implementation Workshop!
- Learn how to write tests that cover all of your backend and frontend code. Web Application Testing covers unit testing, E2E, integration testing, and more!

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```
